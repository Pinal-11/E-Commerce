# E-commerce project.

In this project I have used HTML CSS and Javascript to build the front end.
In the backend i have connected models using postgreSQL database.

In this project 8 category wise apps were built. In each app I have created models and migrated it. aslo mapping of URL and view is done.
Here category wise product pages are built in which users have sorting options according to price and special offer...
